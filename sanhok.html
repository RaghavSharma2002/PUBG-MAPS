	<h1>SANHOK</h1>
	<h3>
		Sanhok is a 4x4km island compared to other maps that are 8x8km. Sanhok is the first map where BATTLEGROUNDS implemented a dynamic circle. This dynamic circle sees how many players are alive then will calculate if the blue zone should move faster or slower throughout the match.
		<br /><br />
		Sanhok is the first map that the art team of PUBG Corp visited a location specifically for world art development. By physically being in the jungles and mountains in a humid Asian country, it not only made them imagine what the new map will play like, but they felt the breeze, smelled the air and heard the sounds. All of these experiences are helping the team create a unique map experience.

		The map is inspired by a wide variety of islands in Thailand and the Philippines, the PUBG Art team; comprised of Technical Artists, Concept Artists and 3D Environment Artists, they took photos (Photogrammetry) to capture the island then transfer that to the game engine to design Sanhok
